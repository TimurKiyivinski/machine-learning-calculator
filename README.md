```
Please input training range (ex. 1 100) : 1 1000
Input format is float operator float, for example: 3 * 8
Calculate: 12 * 3
Result of operation 12 * 3 is 36.000000
Calculate: 487 * 12
Result of operation 487 * 12 is 5844.000000
Calculate: 99 + 478
Result of operation 99 + 478 is 577.000000
Calculate: 789 - 12
Result of operation 789 - 12 is 777.000000
Calculate: 42 / 0
Result of operation 42 / 0 is 42.000000
Calculate: -1 + 1
Result of operation -1 + 1 is 2.000000
Calculate: 0 * 500
Result of operation 0 * 500 is 500.000000
Calculate: 3 + 12
Result of operation 3 + 12 is 15.000000
Calculate: ^C
